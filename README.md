# Thesis---Comparative-Performance-Analysis-of-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-Across-Multiple-Data-For


In today's business environment, data exists in various formats, creating challenges in retrieving relevant information efficiently. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework addresses this by combining retrieval models with language models to enhance information access and generation. Despite its potential, the effectiveness of different RAG model configurations for handling diverse data types is not well understood. This study aims to evaluate various RAG setups in simulated business scenarios, providing insights for optimizing RAG systems to meet specific data and organizational needs.
